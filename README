# ECM1414-Data Structures and Algorithms - Huffman Coding
The Github can be found at - https://github.com/js1294/ECM1414-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
## Description
This is a huffman coder and decoder. This allows it to compress and decompress text files.
It is a type of lossless compression so no data will be lost through this processes.
For more information go to /Specification and check the pdf 
## Build Status
This is currently incomplete with both problems with the compressed and decompressed files.
## Code Style
This is in java with both the .class and .java files in the Source Code folder.
The documentation about the code can be found in the /Source Code/doc.
## Installation
To install the code make sure to put all the text files inside /Source Code/Data Sets.
Put fib41 (artifical), english.001 (pseudo-real) and einstien.de (real) from the
repetitive corpus dataset (http://pizzachili.dcc.uchile.cl/repcorpus.html).
Make sure to unzip them and have them as a text document.
Put the books Romeo and Juilet, Macbeth in English, French and German.
They are from project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org).
## Testing
The huffman tree was tested on Romeo and Juilet, Macbeth in English, French and German.
These books were taken from project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org).
This was done to test the impacts of having different languages being used and if actual
texts worked on the huffman coder.
The repetitive corpus dataset was used for testing to, with fib41 (artifical),
 english.001 (pseudo-real) and einstien.de (real).
This was done to test the impact of repetative characters on the huffman coder.
For more information on the testing check the video at the folder /Recording.
